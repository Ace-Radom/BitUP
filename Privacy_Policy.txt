            BitUP project privacy policy
               Version 2, Feb 04 2023

The usage and operational logic of BitUP dictates that 
it must collect the necessary data on your computer to 
ensure the proper functioning of the program. 
Data collection always leads to privacy problems. I do
respect your privacy, and here is the privacy policy.

  1. BitUP only collects the following datas:
     - your files which need to be backuped by BitUP
     - these files' paths, which maybe contain some of
       your personal infomation
     - system settings, including:
       - system type (Windows, Linux, etc.)
       - system time
     All of these datas will only be saved locally.

  2. BitUP only connects to the Internet when checking
     available updates from Github. It will not upload
     any datas to the Internet.

  3. BitUP never uploads datas. All hash calculations,
     files backup, and other things bitup does will be
     done locally, and log files will only be saved on
     your computer.

  4. BitUP's algorithm does not care about the content
     of the file. It will read the files which need to
     be backuped only for Hash calculations.
